# Plexe Results

This repository contains machine learning solutions automatically generated by Plexe, an AI-powered AutoML system. All experiments were conducted with a 1-hour time limit on CPU-only systems.

## OpenML AutoML Benchmark
Results for 20 datasets from the OpenML automl benchmark suite, competing against leading AutoML frameworks like AutoGluon, H2O AutoML, and FLAML:
- Generated solution code in Python
- Performance metrics (AUC scores)
- Datasets spanning multiple domains: finance, healthcare, computer vision, etc.

## Kaggle Competitions 
Solutions for 11 diverse Kaggle competitions, achieving competitive rankings:
- Generated solution code in Python
- Competition performance metrics
- Domains include: house price prediction, blood glucose prediction, NLP, and more
